# LeetCodeAlgorithms
This is a collection of my submissions to LeetCode Algorithms problems in Java and C++. Eventually I will ensure that there is a submission for each but I swapped between the two since my class work was in C++ but I am more comfortable in Jave (as most of us are. Yay for garbage collectors!).

Anyway, many of these are classic problems posed in Computer Science courses, but a few are pretty interesting. Once again, DO NOT LOOK AT THESE BEFORE AT LEAST ATTEMPTING THE SOLUTIONS ON YOUR OWN. You are doing yourself no favors.

I might have to go back through a few of these as well since I do not remember the solution.

Hope this helps.
